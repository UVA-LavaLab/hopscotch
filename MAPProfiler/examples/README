Examples showcasing MAPProfiler usage.

Build instructions
==================

    a) To build all examples, run 'make' from the current (examples) directory. e.g.,
        $ make
    b) To build a specific example, run 'make <example_name>' from the current directory. e.g.,
        $ make scatter
    c) Each example have their own makefile, which can also be uesd to build. e.g.,
        $ cd scatter
        $ make
    d) To clean all examples, run 'clean' from the current directory. e.g.,
        $ make clean
    e) To clean a specific example, run 'make <example_name>.clean'. e.g.,
        $ make scatter.clean
    f) Another way of cleaning specific examples:
        $ cd scatter
        $ make clean
