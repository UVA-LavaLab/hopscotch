Hopscotch v1.0
==============

I. Overview

  Hopscotch is a micro-benchmark suite for memory performace evaluation. Currently it supports empirically measuring roofline, bandwidth measurement with different access patterns and latency measurement. GPU is also supported for roofline. A memory access pattern visualizer (MAPProfiler) is also included with Hopscotch. MAPProfiler currently supports only x86_64 executables.

  It is under active development. Latest source codes can be found on:
  https://github.com/alifahmed/hopscotch

  Details about most of the kernels and benchmark can be found in the paper:
  A. Ahmed, K. Skadron, "Hopscotch: A Micro-benchmark Suite for Memory Performance Evaluation", MEMSYS, 2019.

II. Prerequisite

  a) Python 3
  b) MAPProfiler requires Intel Pin Tool. Check the README inside MAPProfiler for details.


III. Installation

  Running make from top directory will build all the sub-directories. Binaries are created inside the respective benchmark's directory. Make can also be run inside a benchmark's directory to build just that specific benchmark. Some benchmarks will use scripts to rebuild the binaries with different configurations.
  

IV. CPU Benchmarks

  1_roofline
  ==========
    Measures the maximum attainable performance with varying arithmetic intensity.
    
    To run: ./roofline_cpu.py
    
    The python script will generate a pdf for the roofline plot. Available options can be found
    using ./roofline_cpu.py --help


  2_bandwidth
  ===========
    Measures bandwidth with different types of access patterns.

    To run:  a) make
             b) ./bandwidth

    Working set size can be changed by defining HS_ARRAY_ELEM, which denotes number of elements in the working set array.
    HS_ARRAY_ELEM can be defined directy if manually compiling, or can be passes with USER_DEF.

    Example: a) make USER_DEF="-DHS_ARRAY_ELEM=1000000"
             b) ./bandwidth


  3_latency
  ==========
    Measures the latency with a single threaded pointer chasing kernel. Working set size is varied.
    
    To run: ./latency.py
    
    The python script will generate a pdf for the latency plot. Available options can be found
    using ./latency.py --help
  

  4_cache
  ===========
    Measures cache efficiency by running workloads with different spatial and temporal locality ({low,low}, {low,high}, {high,low}, {high,high})
    
    To run:  a) make
             b) ./cache
    
    Working set size can be changed by defining HS_ARRAY_ELEM, which denotes number of elements in the working set array.
    HS_ARRAY_ELEM can be defined directy if manually compiling, or can be passes with USER_DEF.
    
    Example: a) make USER_DEF="-DHS_ARRAY_ELEM=1000000"
             b) ./cache


IV. GPU Benchmarks

  1_roofline
  ==========
    Measures the maximum attainable performance with varying arithmetic intensity.
    Supports single and double precision floating point operations.
    
    To run: ./roofline.py
    
    The python script will generate a pdf for the roofline plot. Available options can be found
    using ./roofline.py --help
